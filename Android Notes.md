# Random Number App

- Android apps are made from a layout which express how the app is supposed to look. They are  made by different views which are rectangular components that do things.
- The code behind a layout is called an activity it defines how things work
- Activities are the entry point for the app and there should be a setContentView() function that ties the activity to a view.

Views have a designer piece in Android Studio to manipulate views. Using this view gives you the ability to drag and drop views into the main container which is called a constraint.

Constraints allow positioning and styling views to be made relative to the constraint making positioning much easier. So with trying to center something you can constrain it to the left and the right

In the designer you can see two screens, the design the blueprint or both
When making views it's mostly click n drag with layout and styling being done by tweaking the view attributes in the studio

There are several kinds of views, widgets, buttons etc all with several different kinds of attributes to use.
Measurements are done in two units sp & dp

* sp: scale-independent pixels
* dp: density-independent pixels

Both are densidty independent and both render independent of device sp is used for text and dp is used for anything else
